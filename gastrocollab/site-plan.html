      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
          Our goal is to provide original and quality recipes. Provide varied recipes. This site is to make known the rich gastronomic culture that students of cuisine develop, to provide an incredible taste. So that I can provide you with a starting point of making your own recipe. It will also offer a way, in the future, to publish your own version, being a great free collaboration project of gastronomy and recipes.

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Here I will indicate a receipt gallery with images about receipts in catalog, only to exhibition, I will use a background property with the url() function to call the original reference to websites, this is intended to save html file size on rendering.  Also, I will put the purpose of the web site and a possible propaganda to promote this website, with text. 
        People come to my site to search for new receipts. Gastronomy students do something called an 'author recipe' which consists of putting together a reinterpretation of many recipes adding something new and original. Many of these recipes that are presented to the teachers, which the students know in the presentations, are forgotten. I venture to say that there are some incredible ideas that may interest the most tasteful and curious minds there are, when they see fresh recipes coming straight from creation.
        -	Easy and affordable recipes.
        -	How to cook step by step.
        -	Anyone can participate.
        -	It's completely free and collaborative.
        -	It is a site for people who have basic knowledge in cooking.
        This page, as a presentation page, will show some general data in ‘info’ and the gallery will be interactive. This general data will be the total of collaborators, people who entered in this page and receipts number.

      <p>Images for the Home page</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Catalog</h3>
      <p>
        Users can access the catalog available and see the receipts they could cook or change them according to their gastronomy experience. This is intended to show what some text and images illustrating the receipts. As a menu, however it will show how to do the receipt. 
        First, they will be able to see and choose only some recipes available on the site. Later this project will use reactive component resources, client, and server-side programming, as well as a database to store the recipes. Now, visitors will only see an interactive page where they will be able to see some recipes from gastronomy undergraduate students. I also will use url() function in some images, except img1 and img2 that are the images assigned above. These images will reflect receipts descriptions, this is another way to work. One important thing to say is, because the wireframes are compacted, they do not represent exactly the size of the elements, is just to give an idea. Blocks with text ‘Lorem ipsum’ are the blocks assigned to take the receipts description. Even when my source code won’t see any JavaScript for now, user will se some animated characteristics using only CSS, to not looks like a non-static page (those who have only HTML).

      </ul>
      <h3>Contact</h3>
      <p>
        This is a simple HTML/CSS form to send emails with contact information and a receipt to add to the page, this idea is simple, there is nothing complex in this part.
        There are no recipe sites like this one. There are many recipe sites out there, but in this country where I live and in my home country, Mexico, and Brazil - respectively, there is no collaborative repository where students keep recipes made in the classroom. Asking my wife who is a gastronomy student and her sister who studied gastronomy at another university, they informed me that the original recipes are very good, they are not kept anywhere, they are simply forgotten. Can you imagine all this culinary wealth not being shared? 
        To share recipes, if users want to give an idea or if they already have an original recipe that they want to give freely to other cooks, they can inform their email and name, in contacts, when sending recipes or suggestions. They will be able to send you a descriptive recipe via email, so that it can be reviewed and added to those that are visible. This will use the HTML5, this is a way to ‘validate’ text using just HTML. In the future this could relate to some server validation along databases. This is just a simple HTML prototype form.
